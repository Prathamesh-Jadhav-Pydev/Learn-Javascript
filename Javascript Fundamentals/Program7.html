    <h1>Comparions in Javascript</h1>
    <p>
        We know many comparison operators from maths. <br>
        In JavaScript they are written like this: <br>
        Greater/less than: a > b, a < b. <br>
        Greater/less than or equals: a >= b, a <= b. <br>
        Equals: a == b, please note the double equality sign == means the equality test, while a single one a = b means an assignment. <br>
        Not equals: In maths the notation is ≠, but in JavaScript it’s written as a != b.
    </p>
