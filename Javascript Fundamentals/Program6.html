    <title>Chapter 6:- Operators in Javascript</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Operators in Javascript</h1>
    <p>An operand – is what operators are applied to. <br> instance, in the multiplication of 5 * 2 there are two operands: the left operand is 5 and the right operand is 2. Sometimes, <br> people call these “arguments” instead of “operands”.</p>
